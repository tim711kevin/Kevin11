# Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
- Ensure your code is hosted in a GitHub repository.
- Your main HTML file should be named `index.html`. If it's named differently, rename it to `index.html`.

## Step 2: Go to GitHub Settings
- Navigate to your GitHub repository.
- Click on the `Settings` tab.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
- Scroll down to the `Pages` section on the left sidebar.
- Under the `Source` section, select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main`).  
- If your HTML file is in a specific folder (like `/docs`), select that folder as well.
- Click `Save`.

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed Site
- After a few moments, your site will be published.
- GitHub will provide a link to access your deployed site, usually in the format: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Step 5: Verify Deployment
- Click the link provided in the GitHub Pages section to check if your site is live. 

## Step 6: Using the Portal
- You can now interact with your portal as intended. 
- If you encounter any issues, check the browser console for errors.
